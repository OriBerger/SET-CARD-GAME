BONUS CHALLENGE FORM
--------------------

For each bonus challenge you have implemented, please replace the sentence "We are not entitled to this bonus."
with a short description of:

1. How it was implemented in your code
2. Where it was used (in which class methods).
3. How you tested that it is working correctly.

--------------------

1. Fully supporting all configuration fields and avoiding the use of magic numbers

1. We used only the values from env.config and not actual numbers are written in the code. (for example; env.config.tableSize vs 12, setSize = env.config.featureSize vs 3)
2. Dealer:
    removeCardsFromTable
    placeCardsOnTable
    sleepUntilWokenOrTimeout
    updateTimerDisplay
    removeAllCardsFromTable
  Player:
    keyPressed
    point
    penalty
  Table:
    resetSlotToTokens
3. We changed the values in config.properties and checked that the program suports those changes.

--------------------

2. Terminating all threads (that you created) gracefully and in reverse order to the order they were created in.

1. In class Dealer: create player thread in order according to players array, and wait until the thread is completley created (and has created an AI thread if needed), before the creation of the next players thread.
    terminate players threads in reverse order according to players array, and wait until the thread is terminated (and has terminated the AI thread if needed), before the termination of the next players thread.
   In class Player: terminate AI thread if needed, and then terminate oneself.
2. Dealer:
    terminate
    constructor
  Player:
    terminate
    run
3. Using the log, and for many runs check that the termination order is indeed reversed to the creation order.

--------------------

3. Handling the config.turnTimeoutMillis value as follows:
config.turnTimeoutMillis < 0: display nothing.
config.turnTimeoutMillis = 0: display a timer since the last action (reshuffle or set collected).
Note: in modes without a countdown timer the dealer must ensure there is always at least one legal set on the table.

We are not entitled to this bonus.

--------------------

4. Making sure that the threads do not wake up unless some actual job needs to be done (e.g., a value needs to be
changed on the display, key input needs to be handled, etc.) and the only threads created by you are:
1 thread per player + 1 additional thread for non-human players.

We are not entitled to this bonus.
